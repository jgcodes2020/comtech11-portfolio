    <h2>Graphic Design: Poster</h2>
    <p>
      When I was deciding what to do, I consi&shy;dered what was rele&shy;vant
      but somewhat for&shy;gotten. The answer? Ukraine. By this point, the
      war had raged on for about a year, so news stations had rele&shy;gated
      the issue to poli&shy;tical meetings.
    </p>
    <p>
      I used the official Pantone colours that were released by the company
      in support of Ukraine. I decided to use yel&shy;low as the back&shy;ground and
      blue as the fore&shy;ground because if I did it the other way around, that
      would be IKEA's colour scheme. And I'm not going to infringe on a popular
      brand lest my poster become asso&shy;ciated with it.

    <h2>Photography: Portraits</h2>
    <p>
      As Mr. Layton once said, "Portaits can capture emotion." Or something like that.
      When Bagavan and I were planning, we just went with whatever came to mind. In
      hindsight, quite a few of our photos were kinda depressing, and I think that
      reflects our states of mind to some degree.
    </p>
    <p>
      There were lots of failed shots that went into this project, but each failed shot
      taught us a new lesson which we applied to subsequent shots. I also have gained a
      newfound appreciation for the functionality a dedicated camera provides.

    <h2>Film: Scene Recreation</h2>
    <p>
      This is a purposely terrible reaction of a scene from <i>The Office</i>, S1 E1 
      (timestamps: 13:55&ndash;14:33, 14:50&ndash;16:10). We were considering the issue
      with actors, since we didn't have enough people to film everyone all at once. Luckily,
      we managed to procure an extra person (Chloe) and our teacher (Mr. Layton) to play
      the remaining roles.
