    <h1>Reflecting on this class</h1>
    <p>
      I originally did not intend to take this class. It was an alternate.
      Unfortunately, due to scheduling mishaps with two other classes, I ended up here.
      Despite coming here without expecting it, I think this class has proved beneficial to
      to me. I learned how to use Adobe software (should I ever need to use it), as well as
      a lot of professional jargon used among the media industry.
