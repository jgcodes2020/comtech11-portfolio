    <h2>About me</h2>
    <p>
      I like to think of myself as a somewhat creative person. My
      main hobbies are program&shy;ming, and on occasion, com&shy;pos&shy;ing/ar&shy;rang&shy;ing 
      music. I tend to be reserved most of the time, but when I am allowed
      to be creative, it shines through. I want to be able to make a positive impact
      on this world using whatever skills I have.

    <h2>Goals</h2>
    <p>
      I'm going into Grade 12, and that means I have university soon. I want to
      develop good academic habits and do my work more, so I can get better marks.
      Unfor&shy;tunately, univer&shy;sities seem to care about marks first before people, so
      a high mark is the only way to ensure I actually get consi&shy;dered <em>as a person</em>
      instead of a number on a report card.
    </p>
    <p>
      I plan to study electrical engineering in university, as the other computer-focused majors
      (computer science, software engineering, computer engineering) have way too much competition.

    <h2>Reflection</h2>
    <p>
      Out of the three projects we did this semester, I think the film was the best one.
      It was fun and engaging, and it ended up being absolutely hilarious to watch the final
      pro&shy;duct. In terms of things I could im&shy;prove, I would probably have re&shy;fo&shy;cused the camera 
      in certain shots. I de&shy;mon&shy;strated learning skills the most during the film project: I set
      up a document to coordinate filming times and cast roles, allowing us to figure out what
      to film when.

    <h2>Describing my art style</h2>
    <p>
      I am a big believer in simplicity. You'll see that in this website: I use
      a monochromatic colour scheme, which is the simplest of the basic types of
      colour scheme. My original plan for my graphic design poster entailed adding
      actual images, which <em>unfortunately</em> were not allowed.
