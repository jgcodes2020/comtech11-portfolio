    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I like to think of myself as a somewhat creative person. My
      main hobbies are program&shy;ming, and on occasion, com&shy;posing/arranging 
      music. I tend to be reserved most of the time, but when I am allowed
      to be creative, it shines through. I want to be able to make a positive impact
      on this world using whatever skills I have.

    <h1>Goals for the semester</h1>
    <p>
      I'm going into Grade 12, and that means I have university soon. I want to
      develop good academic habits and do my work more, so I can get better marks.
      Unfor&shy;tunately, univer&shy;sities seem to care about marks first before people, so
      a high mark is the only way to ensure I actually get consi&shy;dered <em>as a person</em>
      instead of a number on a report card.
