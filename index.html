    <h1>About me</h1>
    <p>
      I like to think of myself as a somewhat creative person. My
      main hobbies are program&shy;ming, and on occasion, com&shy;posing/arranging 
      music. I tend to be reserved most of the time, but when I am allowed
      to be creative, it shines through.

    <h1>Reflecting on this class</h1>
    <p>
      I originally did not intend to take this class. It was an alternate.
      Thanks to scheduling mishaps with two other classes, I ended up here.
      Despite coming here without expecting it, I think this class has proved beneficial to
      to me. I learned how to use Adobe software (should I ever need to use it), as well as
      a lot of professional jargon used within the media industry.
