      The people here are all YouTubers, as they are my main source of high-effort media. I generally don't watch
      actual movies and TV shows. For some reason, I used to be pretty sensitive to them. I still am, just not as much.

    <h2>Alan Becker</h2>
    <p>
      Alan Becker is an animator and animation director on YouTube. His rise to fame began with a video
      titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npTC6b5-yvM">Ani&shy;mator vs. Ani&shy;mation</a>
      and ever since, he's been buil&shy;ding con&shy;tent off of animated stick figures play&shy;ing around
      on his com&shy;puter and in video games. I personally admire how he's taken such simple characters
      and given them such depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He isn't doing this alone, though. He now has a sizable animation team helping him out, as well as
      a few sound desi&shy;gners and a com&shy;poser helping him out. Many of the team's recent works can be
      described as cinematic <em>mas&shy;ter&shy;pie&shy;ces</em>. If you'd like to check out his work, the link is

    <h2>Kevin & Luke Lerdwichagul</h2>
    <p>
      This duo of animators-turned-showrunners started with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SMG4">meme channel</a>
      filled with what can generally be called high-effort crapposting (is there a better word for it?). They would then
      conso&shy;lidate their efforts into a com&shy;pany called <a>Glitch Productions</a>, where they began running more
      serious
      animated webseries. Today, they have suc&shy;cess&shy;fully ran 3 seasons of one of their own series, <a
        href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHovnlOusNLj_bSwvpE3ycI4iHuJDRCps"><i>Meta Runner</i></a>, and are
      currently backing another show, <a
        href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHovnlOusNLiJz3sm0d5i2Evwa2LDLdrg"><i>Murder Drones</i></a>, written
      and directed by fellow animator Liam Vic&shy;kers. I appreciate them giving other creators a creative out&shy;let
      they would
      not have had otherwise. The video here is the pilot episode of <i>Meta Runner</i>.

    <h2>Cary and Michael Huang</h2>
    <p>
      This duo started the animated webseries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_49oVhJEpM"><i>Battle For Dream
          Island</i></a> at the age of 12, and have kept it alive well into their early 20's. The aforementioned show
      and its later de&shy;scen&shy;dants are centered around person&shy;ified household objects who compete for a
      prize. If the art style appears even slightly familiar, you may recognize those same mouth graphics plastered all
      over some of the cringier content on YouTube. I admire their persistence in keeping the show alive, despite several
      bouts of burnout.
