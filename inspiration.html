      The people here are all YouTubers, as they are my main source of high-effort media. I generally don't watch
      actual movies and TV shows. For some reason, I used to be pretty sensitive to them. I still am, just not as much.

    <h2>Alan Becker</h2>
    <p>
      Alan Becker is an ani&shy;mator and ani&shy;mation direc&shy;tor on YouTube. His rise to fame began with a video
      titled <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npTC6b5-yvM">Ani&shy;mator vs. Ani&shy;mation</a>
      and ever since, he's been buil&shy;ding con&shy;tent off of ani&shy;mated stick fi&shy;gures play&shy;ing around
      on his com&shy;puter and in video games. I personally ad&shy;mire how he's taken such simple cha&shy;rac&shy;ters
      and given them such depth.
    </p>
    <p>
      He isn't doing this alone, though. He now has a sizable ani&shy;mation team,
      a few sound desi&shy;gners and a com&shy;poser helping him out. Many of the team's recent works can be
      best de&shy;scribed as cine&shy;matic mas&shy;ter&shy;pie&shy;ces. If you'd like to check out his work, the link
      is

    <h2>Kevin & Luke Lerdwichagul</h2>
    <p>
      This duo of ani&shy;mators-turned-show&shy;runners started with a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/c/SMG4">meme
        chan&shy;nel</a>
      filled with memey parody videos invol&shy;ving Mario, Luigi, and se&shy;veral ori&shy;ginal charac&shy;ters. They
      would then
      con&shy;so&shy;li&shy;date their efforts into a com&shy;pany called <a>Glitch Pro&shy;duc&shy;tions</a>, where
      they began run&shy;ning more
      serious
      ani&shy;mated web&shy;series. Today, they have suc&shy;cess&shy;fully ran 3 sea&shy;sons of one of their own
      series, <a href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHovnlOusNLj_bSwvpE3ycI4iHuJDRCps"><i>Meta Runner</i></a>, and
      are
      cur&shy;rent&shy;ly backing ano&shy;ther show, <a
        href="https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHovnlOusNLiJz3sm0d5i2Evwa2LDLdrg"><i>Murder Drones</i></a>, written
      and directed by fellow animator Liam Vic&shy;kers. I appreciate them giving other creators a creative out&shy;let
      they would not have had otherwise.

    <h2>Cary and Michael Huang</h2>
    <p>
      This duo started the animated webseries <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=H_49oVhJEpM"><i>Battle For Dream
          Island</i></a> at the age of 12, and have kept it alive well into their early 20's. The afore&shy;men&shy;tioned show
      and its later de&shy;scen&shy;dants are centered around person&shy;ified house&shy;hold ob&shy;jects who compete for a
      prize. If the art style appears even slightly familiar, you may recognize those same mouth gra&shy;phics plas&shy;tered all
      over all sorts of ran&shy;dom YouTube thumb&shy;nails. I admire their per&shy;sis&shy;tence in keeping their show alive, despite
      several bouts of burn&shy;out.
    </p>
    <p>
      In addition to their ani&shy;mation channel, Cary (right&shy;most on the photo) also runs his own solo
      chan&shy;nel <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@carykh">(carykh)</a>, where he posts
      about ran&shy;dom pro&shy;gram&shy;ming pro&shy;jects he's worked on. I per&shy;son&shy;ally found such silly
      pro&shy;jects inte&shy;res&shy;ting, and it was through Cary's solo chan&shy;nel that I discovered their
      ani&shy;mation chan&shy;nel.

    <h2>Grant Sanderson</h2>
    <p>
      Grant runs the math education channel <a href="https://youtube.com/channel/@3blue1brown">3Blue1Brown</a>.
      He's made videos on a wide variety of gener&shy;ally com&shy;pli&shy;cated topics, such as cal&shy;cu&shy;lus, linear alge&shy;bra, and
      Four&shy;ier ana&shy;lysis. What sets his videos apart is how he breaks down these con&shy;cepts into simple terms that
      a mere high school stu&shy;dent can under&shy;stand. I admire the way he teaches and strive to learn from his ways
      when I teach (I did teach at Computer Science Club this year, and will do so again next year).
