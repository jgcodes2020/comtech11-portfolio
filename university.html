    <h3>Why/Why not Waterloo?</h3>
    <h5>Pros</h5>
    <ul class="bullet-emoji bullet-check">
      <li>
        Best-in-class co-op program&mdash;because no one will hire you
        without work experience these days
      </li>
      <li>
        Lots of similar-minded individuals&mdash;I do lots of nerdy things, Waterloo attracts lots of nerdy people
      </li>
      <li>
        Intensive program&mdash;Because school will be a lot of work, I'll be accustomed
        to a lot of work before I get a job.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <h5>Cons</h5>
    <ul class="bullet-emoji bullet-cross">
      <li>
        Lots of competition&mdash;Many students at Unionville want to go to Waterloo, lowering my chances.
      </li>
      <li>
        Intensive program&mdash;I will not have much social time because everyone will be studying.
      </li>
      <li>
        Constant presence of geese&mdash;Even though they have become an unoffical mascot, they're still dangerous.
      </li>
    </ul>
