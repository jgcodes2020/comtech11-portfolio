    <h3>Why/Why not Waterloo?</h3>
    <ul class="bullet-emoji bullet-check">
      <li>
        Best-in-class co-op program&mdash;because no one will hire you
        without work experience these days
      </li>
      <li>
        Lots of similar-minded individuals&mdash;I do lots of things that the
        average person wouldn't understand, so it would be nice to have more people
        to relate to
      </li>
      <li>
        Intensive program&mdash;Because school will be a huge grind, I'll be accustomed
        to it by the time I hit work. They will keep you at work for a long time.
      </li>
    </ul>
    <ul class="bullet-emoji bullet-cross">
      <li>
        Lots of competition&mdash;Everyone wants to go to Waterloo at this school, so this
        lowers my chances
      </li>
      <li>
        Intensive program&mdash;I will not have much social time because everyone will be
        studying.
