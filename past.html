    <h2>Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      I originally made this track as uplifting corporate-esque music for a promo&shy;tional
      video my dad wanted to run on his website. He didn't exactly like it, so I ended up
      releasing it as a stand&shy;alone track on my YouTube channel. Somehow a few stran&shy;gers
      have come across it, and appa&shy;rently they liked it. Un&shy;for&shy;tun&shy;ately, I haven't gotten
      back into music pro&shy;duc&shy;tion in a long while, so you might not hear any new tracks from me.
      <em>Or maybe you will.</em> Only time will tell.

    <h2>Bing Bing Bong</h2>
    <p>
      10-year-old me was a massive Trump fan because he knew no better. Trump made <a
        href="https://youtu.be/niSLZDVApdQ">this funny speech</a> where he went "Bing,
      bing, bong, bong, you know what that is right?" Naturally, 10-year-old decided to
      remix it, creating this abom&shy;ina&shy;tion. If you want to know where the pictures came
      from, I actually did go into <em>the</em> Trump Tower in New York once and took a
      bunch of photos.

    <h2>Animation of "Speaking Moistly"</h2>
    <p>
      In 2020, Prime Mini&shy;ster Justin Tru&shy;deau uttered <a href="https://youtu.be/slK5IY_GJzI?t=31">a legen&shy;dary
        sentence</a> that would etch it&shy;self firmly into the minds of Cana&shy;dians for years to come. I was
      toying around with Flipa&shy;Clip, using my fin&shy;ger to draw things, and I made this ani&shy;ma&shy;tion. I think it ac&shy;tually
      blew up a little bit after You&shy;Tube Shorts came out, so that's why it has around 2500 views now.

    <h2>UHS Game Jam website</h2>
    <p>
      I made this website back in Grade 9 for the BTT1O1 course (aka. <i>Information and Technology in Business</i>)
      The project was to advertise a fictional event, so I decided to make it a website for a fictional school-sponsored
      game jam. Some of the images are unfortunately gone, but it still works for the most part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you weren't aware, a <dfn>game jam</dfn> is an event where competitors attempt to code a game (typically
      on a given theme) within a given period of time (typically 1-2 days). If you have heard of a hackathon, it is
      similar to that.

    <h2>M64RPFW: an N64 emulator frontend (WIP)</h2>
    <p>
      This project of mine is a GUI layer on top of the excel&shy;lent <a>Mupen64Plus</a> N64 emu&shy;lator.
      It's still a work in pro&shy;gress, and most of the code is pri&shy;vate until we actually re&shy;lease this.
      However, much of the core code is working, and the screen&shy;shot beside this para&shy;graph is a demo
      of it work&shy;ing. In ad&shy;di&shy;tion to the messy job of hooking up the emu&shy;lator, there is a user inter&shy;face,
      and I figured this would work as UI design falls well into the realm of commu&shy;ni&shy;ca&shy;tions tech&shy;no&shy;logy.
