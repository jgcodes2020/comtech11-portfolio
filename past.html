    <h2>Resilience</h2>
    <p>
      I originally made this track as uplifting corporate-esque music for a promotional
      video my dad wanted to run on his website. He didn't exactly like it, so I ended up
      releasing it as a standalone track on my YouTube channel. Somehow a few strangers
      have come across it.

    <h2>Bing Bing Bong</h2>
    <p>
      10-year-old me was a massive Trump fan because he knew no better. Trump made <a
        href="https://youtu.be/niSLZDVApdQ">this funny speech</a> where he went "Bing,
      bing, bong, bong, you know what that is right?" Naturally, 10-year-old decided to
      remix it, creating this abomination. If you want to know where the pictures came
      from, I actually did go into <em>the</em> Trump Tower in New York once and took a
      buttload of photos.

    <h2>Animation of "Speaking Moistly"</h2>
    <p>
      In 2020, Prime Minister Justin Trudeau uttered <a href="https://youtu.be/slK5IY_GJzI?t=31">a legendary
        sentence</a> that would etch themselves firmly into the minds of Canadians for years to come. I was
      toying around with FlipaClip, using my finger to draw things, and I made this animation. I think it actually
      blew up a little bit after YouTube Shorts came out, so that's why it has around 2500 views now.

    <h2>Business Technology Website</h2>
    <p>
      I made this website back in Grade 9 for the BTT1O1 course (aka. <i>Information and Technology in Business</i>)
      The project was to advertise a fictional event, so I decided to make it a website for a fictional school-sponsored
      game jam. Some of the images are unfortunately gone, but it still works for the most part.
    </p>
    <p>
      In case you weren't aware, a <dfn>game jam</dfn> is an event where competitors attempt to code a game (typically
      on a given theme) within a given period of time (typically 1-2 days). If you have heard of a hackathon, it is
      similar to that.
